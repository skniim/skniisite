This system is designed to be both a personalized landing page, and a digital playground where various technologies are tested. 

SHORTCUTS:
You can manage your links via the "Shortcuts" configuration. Add groups to create columns, and subgroups to further organize your bookmarks.

CUSTOMIZATION:
Use the Theme Settings to change the system colors and CRT effects.

BACKUP & SYNC:
Don't forget to export your configuration in the Backup tab to save your layout permanently! 

You can also use "Cloud Sync" to synchronize your shortcuts across devices. Host your JSON configuration on a platform like a GitHub Secret Gist (use the 'Raw' URL) and provide that URL in the Cloud Sync settings. Generate a 'Sync Link' to quickly set up your phone or other devices.`,
